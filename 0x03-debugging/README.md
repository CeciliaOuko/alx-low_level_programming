0 - In most projects, we often give you only one main file to test with. For example, this main file is a test for a postitive_or_negative() function similar to the one you worked with in an earlier C project:

1 - Copy this main file. Comment out (don’t delete it!) the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.

2 - This program prints the largest of three integers.? That’s definitely not right.

Fix the code in 2-largest_number.c so that it correctly prints out the largest of three numbers, no matter the case.

3 - This program converts a date to the day of year and determines how many days are left in the year, taking leap year into consideration. Output looks good for 04/01/1997! Let’s make a new main file 3-main_b.c to try a case that is a leap year: 02/29/2000.? That doesn’t seem right.

Fix the print_remaining_days() function so that the output works correctly for all dates and all leap years.
